# Basic_encrypter_decrypter_tool
This Python-based tool provides a simple yet secure way to encrypt and decrypt text using the cryptography library's Fernet encryption. The tool converts plain text into encrypted bytes, ensuring that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access. With Fernet, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, making the process straightforward and efficient. The tool is ideal for those looking to safeguard their text data, whether for personal or professional use, and serves as a practical introduction to modern encryption techniques.
